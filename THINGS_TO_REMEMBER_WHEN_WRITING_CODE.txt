Things to remember BEFORE committing!

- Make sure you have the latest version so things don't conflict
- Remember that it also has to work with Simba ;)

Things to remember to add when adding new items to ItemInfo.scar:

- Add the item's record in ItemInfo.scar ~ obviously :p.
- Add a string array to MSI_ObjToText in Debug.scar.
- Add a constant for that item in Globals.scar.
- Add the item to the item list case in MSI_GetItemList in Mainloop.scar.
